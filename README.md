# -Excel-Report-Generator
Excel Report Generator is a simple Python project that takes data from a CSV file and turns it into a clear, well-organized Excel report. It uses tools like Pandas and OpenPyXL to read the data, sort or summarize it, and then save it as an Excel file. This makes it easy to get useful reports quickly without doing everything by hand.
